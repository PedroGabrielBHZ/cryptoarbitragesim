# Triangular Arbitrage Optimizer

A sophisticated cryptocurrency arbitrage optimization system using PuLP linear programming to maximize profits from triangular arbitrage opportunities while considering real-world constraints.

## üéØ Overview

This system receives fake triangular arbitrage data from an external analyzer and creates a linear programming optimization model that accounts for:

- **Liquidity constraints** - Available trading volume on each exchange
- **Transaction fees** - Exchange fees for each trade
- **Minimum holding requirements** - Portfolio balance constraints  
- **Volume limitations** - Maximum position sizes
- **Risk management** - Portfolio risk tolerance

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

   - Handles portfolio constraints and risk management
   - Generates optimal investment allocation

2. **FakeArbitrageAnalyzer** (`arbitrage_detector.py`)
   - Simulates external arbitrage opportunity detection

## üîß Configuration Options

### Portfolio Settings
```python
# Conservative portfolio
system = ArbitrageSystem(
    portfolio_value=50_000,
    risk_profile='conservative'  # 5-15% risk tolerance
)

# Aggressive portfolio  
system = ArbitrageSystem(
    portfolio_value=500_000,
    risk_profile='aggressive'    # 35-60% risk tolerance
)
```

### Market Conditions
```python
# Access market simulator
market = system.market_simulator

# Current conditions
print(f"Volatility: {market.market_conditions.volatility_index:.3f}")
print(f"Sentiment: {market.market_conditions.market_sentiment}")
print(f"Liquidity Factor: {market.market_conditions.liquidity_factor:.3f}")
```

## üßÆ Mathematical Model

### Objective Function
```
Maximize: Œ£(i=1 to n) profit_i √ó confidence_i √ó investment_i
```

### Constraints

1. **Liquidity Constraints**:
   ```
   Œ£(consumption_factor_i √ó investment_i) ‚â§ available_liquidity_pair
   ```

2. **Balance Constraints**:
   ```
   Œ£(investment_i) ‚â§ available_balance_currency
   ```

### Profit Calculation
```python
def calculate_triangular_profit(rate_ab, rate_bc, rate_ca, fees):
    effective_ab = rate_ab * (1 - fees[0])
    effective_bc = rate_bc * (1 - fees[1]) 
    effective_ca = rate_ca * (1 - fees[2])
    final_amount = effective_ab * effective_bc * effective_ca
    return final_amount - 1.0

### Risk Considerations
- Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile
- Arbitrage opportunities can disappear quickly
- Transaction costs and slippage can eliminate profits
- Regulatory compliance may be required

### Performance Optimization
- Use faster solvers (CPLEX, Gurobi) for large problems
- Implement parallel processing for multiple opportunities
- Add real-time data caching
- Optimize constraint generation
